  <p1>A little description about me is that I have a Chinese background,
  as my parents are Cantonese born in Vietnam, although the languages I'm
  able to speak are Cantonese, English and Mandarin.
  My latest completed education was a VCE high school diploma, and although
  I am quite nervous, I am excited to begin university. At my leisure, I
  enjoy drawing, playing video games and listening to music. </p1>

<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Interest in IT</h2>


</div>

  <p style="border-width:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#d5cfe1;
  padding: 1em;">What intrigues me about IT is to create things that I like
  that require the use of computer technology. Design, which is also an interest
  of mine, and IT go hand in hand. I find areas like UI/UX design, game
  development, or anything interactive to be quite intriguing, hence it's
  something I'd like to explore more of. I'd like to create personal projects,
  expand creative ideas, and enhance my abilities through the use of technology.
  The dedication and effort put in IT career work inspires me to also create
  something by using my own knowledge and hands. Hoping someday, people would
  find my ideas to be helpful. I’m only slightly knowledgeable on small areas
  about computer hardware and common computer shortcuts. As career experience,
  I have also never set foot in the anywhere in the IT industry.
  I have heard that RMIT is a well received institution and gives a great
  opening to the IT industry. Technology related courses are said to be more
  hands on which I find much better for learning. I'm looking forward to
  learning variety of subjects to find the most suitable path for me.
  Exploring not only the technical side of IT but business, data and law in
  relation to sharpen my craft in other aspects of IT.</p>

    <p2> My ideal career lies somewhere in the UI/UX industry, and an example
    I selected is the company Just Digital People.
    They have a strong focus on creativity and ability, which is what I’m
    looking for to get the most out of my career. They also offer working
    remote and flexible which allows me to focus effectively and manage my
    time at my own pace, at the comfort of my own home. As I'm not under pressure
    I have a sharper mind allowing me to focus on ideas more effectively,
    reflected in
    correspondence to my MBTI and work style. <br>
    Their focal skills wanted emphasises on strong communication passion
    for endless creativity with the process of design with the experience.
    Although their experience specifications aren’t listed, It’s a common
    requirement to have 3+ years of expertise in UI/UX design with company
    experience and a number of portfolios showcasing your strengths.
    CSS, HTML, JavaScript knowledge is also required and may also require
    expertise in software such as Sketch, Framer, Axure, etc.<br>
    My Experience: I have no current work experience in this field, however
    I have dabbled in some creative software such as Adobe Animate, Adobe
    After Effects, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. I’ve also worked on
    Graphic Design projects and now beginning to study the basics of HTML,
    CSS and Python. <br>
    Plan: Not only will I be learning from this course, I’ll find different
    free online sources to practice and sharpen my work if I have the time.
    Eventually I'd like to have created personal interactive projects to display
    in my portfolio. </p2>

  padding: 1em;">Through the results of various personality tests, it gives
  me an idea regarding setbacks and assets that influence my work. A major
  factor I'm aware of is that I prefer to work alone. This course will give me
  an opportunity to go outside our comfort zone, and combat my weaknesses. My
  strengths lie in passion of ideas reflecting them into my work. However, for
  my creativity to spark, I must first work alone to comfortably generate those
  ideas, as this is my method to achieve productivity. Since that might be a
  setback for other people, it is something that must be communicated. This
  way, potential team members can avoid assumptions and misunderstandings. A
  method that compliments my work style during group work is to use Google Docs
  for discussion. Where everyone can dump their ideas, and seek approval from
  all group members by commenting. There will still be times where I am not
  vocal about my ideas, but I'm still open to hearing others' suggestions.
  My open mindedness is useful when sorting disagreements as I have an
  understanding across different points of view.  Still, things like these can
  be negotiable. Humility is an aspect of my personality, to create a well
  balanced, cared environment where every voice is heard. This would also
  lessen conflict ease disagreements. When forming a team, it's important that
  I monitor the productivity and try to boost the morale when possible.</p>

  <h5 style="font-size:30px;">Project Idea</h5>
</div>













<div style="background: #d5cfe1;
            font-size: 18px;
            border: 2px solid #d4bebe;
            ">
  Overview: My project idea is an interactive visual guide for learning high
  end duties in the game Final Fantasy 14. It will include imagery and written
  features to help players understand what is happening in the duty, and
  explain the method to approach the mechanics. The duties are simplified,
  having each part separated by animations. This assists players to confront
  each portion of the duty at their own pace. A fast and easy approach that can
  be shared with ease and opened with simple, efficient navigation and
  recognisable imagery.<br>
</div>
<div style="background: #d5cfe1;
            font-size: 18px;
            border: 2px solid #d4bebe;
            ">
  Motivation: There are never enough guides. Different people have different
  methods of explaining and taking in information. So each guide will have a
  different effect. My goal is to not only develop something suitable the
  general player-base, but engage players that have a similar learning style
  to my own. Majority prefer visual guides as they have a visual idea of what
  is happening. Positive feedback is often given by the community where
  creators upload their craft. This is reflected on many sites like YouTube,
  Twitter, and Reddit.<br>

            border: 2px solid #d4bebe;
            ">
  Description:
  <ul>
    <li>The webpage will have a start page where it represents the beginning of a
  specific duty being made a guide on.
    <li>A key words page will be linked to list the name of the specific
      mechanics and a brief description of what they do. If the fight has certain
      status effects, there will be an icon to represent it
      and a brief description of their function.
    <li>There will be a side bar divided into sections to represent timeline and
      each stage of the duty, that can be accessed at any time.
    <li>If you want to go back to a previous slide there is an undo button to
      return. This is particularly useful for players that may have already
      learnt other parts of the fight and just want to come back to polish
      their understanding of a certain mechanic.
    <li>Similar to a page flipping type of transition, but without the webpage
      having to reload, every sub mechanic will have animated icons to represent
       each happening in the duty and how to follow.
    <li>To advance, the user can use their arrow keys on the keyboard to
      indicate whether they would like to go back or proceed; right arrow key to
       next,  left arrow to go back. Alternatively, they can use the space bar
       to proceed.
    <li>The guide will reflect a simplified imagery of the duty, items like
      arena shape, boss icon, status effects, are included and colour coded.
      Animations will also be simplified but familiar enough to recognise in
      comparison to the actual fight.
    <li>Animations will move according to each ‘slide’ controlled by the user.
      For each major explanation needed, a text box will appear containing
      relevant information about the strategy used to explain the mechanic
      and how to resolve it.
    <li>Occasionally there will be small pop up’s that appear on the corner at
      some stages suggesting helpful tips. Users can minimise and re open them
      if they wish.
    <li>Before starting the guide, the user can select and assign a specific
      role to apply onto the icons in the guide, allowing different people
      to screenshot and share the guide to their own groups that suit their in
      game lineup or personal use.
    <li>If users want to access some other guides, there is a home page where
      there will be a list of links to previous duties.
    <li>Firstly separated by duty type: Extreme Trial, Savage Raid, and Ultimate
       Raid.
    <li>Secondly, separated by game expansion: Endwalker, Shadowbringers,
      Stormblood, A Realm Reborn.
    <li>Then finally, divided by a subheading indicative of each patch release,
      there will be a link to each duty guide being made available.
    <li>During a major update for a new duty, the official home page will be
      updated to link the guide for the most recent duty(s). This is because
      they are usually the most sought after, as well as that it is efficient
      for users/players that want to check for a guide at the last minute.

            border: 2px solid #d4bebe;
            ">Tools and Technologies:<br>
  Designs and animations will be created to implement into my
  project. Applications such as Adobe Illustrator and After Effects are necessary
  to create moving designs representing marker icons.
  (Marker icons are a picture that appears on top of a players head signalling
  a different mechanic depending on the icon.)<br>
  For planning, Clip Studio Paint is used to roughly design the UI, icon art
  and majority of the visual elements. All software will be executed
  on a computer. <br>
  Hosted on a webpage with a short URL, you can access it, copy and paste
  with ease in game. Programming languages involve CSS, HTML and JavaScript
  which will cover the function, interactivity and aesthetics. </p>

</div>

<div style="background: #d5cfe1;
            font-size: 18px;
            border: 2px solid #d4bebe;
            ">Skills Required:<br>
  An eye for aesthetics and cohesion. The information needs to be visually
  appealing and coherent. This is helpful as recognisable icons can also be
  used as a quick way to come back to and have a look at when they are in
  duty. A common example of this is users can alt-tab to check during downtime
  or reference on another monitor screen. <br>
  Efficiency and practice with software development is important as it’ll
  determine the speed of the guide's release. Players will be looking for a
  guide not long after a new duty is released. Not only that, but fully
  understand the game mechanics to be able to teach. Reflecting that knowledge
  in the guide to make sure it’s correct and accurate.  </p>

</div>
<div style="background: #d5cfe1;
            font-size: 18px;
            border: 2px solid #d4bebe;
            ">Outcome:<br>
  If the project becomes successful, it allows me to get feedback from players
  who decide to use it. There will always be new duties that come out giving me
  an opportunity to develop new things guides and release them for players
  eager to learn the new fight.<br>
  The issue I aim to solve is to help people that are reluctant to attempt high
  end content because they are afraid they don't have the ability. This serves
  as an alternative to video guides. As skipping through the timeline trying to
  find what you need is time consuming and frustrating.  </p>
